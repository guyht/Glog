The Glog Blog
=============

The idea of the Glog Blog was to create a super simple, Git and Node.js backed blog that used markdown for formatting.  I find Wordpress tremendously cumbersome and wanted to come up with a super simple solution.  Glog is (currently) entirely written in under 350 lines of JavaScript.

# Features
- Git and Node.js backed
- Simple to setup
- Easy configuration
- Custom URLs
- Disqus and Google Analytic support


# Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:guyht/Glog.git
    $ cd Glog
	$ npm install
    $ cp glog_config.sample.json glog_config.json
    $ vi glog_config.sample.json

- Edit glog_config.sample.json, and rename to glog_config.json
- Set up a github hook to trigger http://yourbloglocation/__render when a new update is pushed
- Run

    `$ node server.js`

Your blog should now be up and running

# Guido

Guido [https://github.com/guyht/Guido](https://github.com/guyht/Guido) is the default template for Glog.  It consists of a simplistic layout and a couple of examples to get you going.  I suggest that you use it as a starting point (i.e. fork it) for your own blog.  The glog_config.json file contains the Guido repository as a default.

# The principle

The blog content is stored in a git repository that has the following structure

    /
    |
    +- layout.jade
    |
    +- articles/
    |  |
    |  +- article-1.txt
    |  |
    |  +- article-2.txt
    |
    +- public/
       |
       +- main.css

**The articles folder** contains blog entries.  Each blog entry consists or a JSON header that defines the author, date, blog entry title, and optionally a custom url. The blog content is written in markdown.  Below is an example.

    {
    	"title"  : "A Test Article",
    	"author" : "Guy",
    	"date"   : "12/21/2011",
        "url"    : "a-test-article"
    }

    This is the content of the post.  You can use markdown to format it,
    for example, *this text will appear in italic*, **and this will appear in bold**.

You could then add your new blog entry as follows

    $ git add articles/a-test-article.txt
    $ git commit -m "Added new article: A Test Article"
    $ git push origin master

If your git hook is setup correctly, the changes will automatically be pushed to your Glog blog!

**The public folder** contains any css files that are required by the layout.jade template

**The layout.jade file** contains the template for the blog.

The entire blog content is parsed and loaded into memory.  Whenever a new article is published, a git hook triggers the myblog/__render URL which will tell Glog to re-render the blog and update its contents.
